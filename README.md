I've been taking the C++ Unreal Engine Course on Udemy, and making this Bull Cow Game has been fun, it is just unfortunate that the compilation time is lagged due to conflicting UE versions. Thus, when you copy/download this, **please only take the BullCowGame.sln** file because it contains the coding functionality of the project. 

Do not take the rest, instead download the original project files here: https://github.com/UnrealCourse2019/BullCowGame

### The important files here are:
- BullCowCartridge.cpp
- BullCowCartridge.h
- HiddenWordList.h
